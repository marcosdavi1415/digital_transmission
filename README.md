# Channel Estimation

## Instructions

1) The main file is "DoublySelectiveChannelEstimation". This code uses the "FastFading" file to channel estimation, which has some function at the end of file that plot graphs with delay and frequency.

2) The lines 188 and 189 of the main file call the plot functions, which plot graph with "frequency correlation x frequency" and "power delay profile x delay".

3) To not run all the code, it is necessary to put the breakpoint after line 189.
